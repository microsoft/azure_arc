## Deploy a vanilla Azure Arc Data Controller on a Microk8s Kubernetes cluster in an Azure VM using ARM template

The following Jumpstart scenario will guide you on how to deploy a "Ready to Go" environment so you can start using [Azure Arc-enabled data services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/data/overview) deployed on a single-node [Microk8s](https://microk8s.io/) Kubernetes cluster.

By the end of this scenario, you will have a Microk8s Kubernetes cluster deployed with an Azure Arc Data Controller and a Microsoft Windows Server 2022 (Datacenter) Azure Client VM, installed & pre-configured with all the required tools needed to work with Azure Arc-enabled data services.

> **NOTE: Currently, Azure Arc-enabled data services with PostgreSQL is in [public preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/data/release-notes)**.

## Prerequisites

- CloneÂ the Azure Arc Jumpstart repository

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc.git
  ```

- [Install or update Azure CLI to version 2.49.0 and above](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). Use the below command to check your current installed version.

  ```shell
  az --version
  ```

- [Generate a new SSH key pair](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/create-ssh-keys-detailed) or use an existing one (Windows 10 and above now comes with a built-in ssh client).

  ```shell
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
  ```

  To retrieve the SSH public key after it's been created, depending on your environment, use one of the below methods:
  - In Linux, use the `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` command.
  - In Windows (CMD/PowerShell), use the SSH public key file that by default, is located in the _`C:\Users\WINUSER/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`_ folder.

  SSH public key example output:

  ```shell
  ssh-rsa o1djFhyNe5NXyYk7XVF7wOBAAABgQDO/QPJ6IZHujkGRhiI+6s1ngK8V4OK+iBAa15GRQqd7scWgQ1RUSFAAKUxHn2TJPx/Z/IU60aUVmAq/OV9w0RMrZhQkGQz8CHRXc28S156VMPxjk/gRtrVZXfoXMr86W1nRnyZdVwojy2++sqZeP/2c5GoeRbv06NfmHTHYKyXdn0lPALC6i3OLilFEnm46Wo+azmxDuxwi66RNr9iBi6WdIn/zv7tdeE34VAutmsgPMpynt1+vCgChbdZR7uxwi66RNr9iPdMR7gjx3W7dikQEo1djFhyNe5rrejrgjerggjkXyYk7XVF7wOk0t8KYdXvLlIyYyUCk1cOD2P48ArqgfRxPIwepgW78znYuwiEDss6g0qrFKBcl8vtiJE5Vog/EIZP04XpmaVKmAWNCCGFJereRKNFIl7QfSj3ZLT2ZXkXaoLoaMhA71ko6bKBuSq0G5YaMq3stCfyVVSlHs7nzhYsX6aDU6LwM/BTO1c= user@pc
  ```

- Create Azure service principal (SP). To deploy this scenario, an Azure service principal Role-based access control (RBAC) is required:

  - "Owner" - Required for provisioning Azure resources, interact with Azure Arc-enabled data services billing, monitoring metrics, logs management and creating role assignment for the Monitoring Metrics Publisher role.

    To create it login to your Azure account run the below command (this can also be done in [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/)).

    ```shell
    az login
    subscriptionId=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)
    SP_CLIENT_ID=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "<Unique SP Name>" --role "Owner" --scopes /subscriptions/$subscriptionId --query appId -o tsv)
    SP_OID=$(az ad sp show --id $SP_CLIENT_ID --query id -o tsv)

    ```

    For example:

    ```shell
    az login
    subscriptionId=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)
    SP_CLIENT_ID=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "JumpstartArcDataSvc" --role "Owner" --scopes /subscriptions/$subscriptionId --query appId -o tsv)
    ```

    Output should look like this:

    ```json
    {
    "appId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "displayName": "JumpstartArcDataSvc",
    "password": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "tenant": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
    ```

    > **NOTE: The Jumpstart scenarios are designed with as much ease of use in-mind and adhering to security-related best practices whenever possible. It is optional but highly recommended to scope the service principal to a specific [Azure subscription and resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest) as well considering using a [less privileged service principal account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/best-practices)**

## Architecture (In a nutshell)

From the [Microk8s GitHub repo](https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s):

_"Microk8s is a single-package, fully conformant, lightweight Kubernetes that works on 42 flavors of Linux. Perfect for Developer workstations, IoT, Edge & CI/CD. MicroK8s tracks upstream and releases beta, RC and final bits the same day as upstream K8s."_

in this scenario, we automate the installation of Microk8s on an Ubuntu 20.04 VM running on Azure using a few simple commands to install from the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/microk8s), before proceeding to onboard it as an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes Cluster.

Once our K8s Cluster is onboarded, we proceed to create a [Custom Location](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/custom-locations), and deploy an Azure Arc Data Controller in [Directly Connected mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/data/connectivity#connectivity-modes).

## Automation Flow

For you to get familiar with the automation and deployment flow, below is an explanation.

- User is editing the ARM template parameters file (1-time edit) and export the Azure Custom Location Resource Provider ([RP](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types)) Object ID (OID) variable to use it as a parameter. These parameters values are being used throughout the deployment.

- Main [_azuredeploy_](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/azuredeploy.json) ARM template will initiate **five** linked ARM templates:

  - [_VNET_](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/VNET.json) - Deploys a Virtual Network with a single subnet - used by our VMs.
  - [_ubuntuMicrok8s_](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/ubuntuMicrok8s.json) - Deploys an Ubuntu Linux VM which will have Microk8s installed from the Snap Store.
  - [_clientVm_](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/clientVm.json) - Deploys the Client Windows VM. This is where all user interactions with the environment are made from.
  - [_mgmtStagingStorage_](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/mgmtStagingStorage.json) - Used for staging files in automation scripts and [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/).
  - [_logAnalytics_](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/logAnalytics.json) - Deploys Azure Log Analytics workspace to support Azure Arc-enabled data services logs upload.

- User remotes into Client Windows VM, which automatically kicks off the [_DataServicesLogonScript_](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/artifacts/DataServicesLogonScript.ps1) PowerShell script that deploys and configure Azure Arc-enabled data services on the Microk8s Kubernetes cluster - including the data controller.

## Deployment

As mentioned, this deployment will leverage ARM templates. You will deploy a single template that will initiate the entire automation for this scenario.

- The deployment is using the ARM template parameters file. Before initiating the deployment, edit the [_azuredeploy.parameters.json_](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/azuredeploy.parameters.json) file located in your local cloned repository folder. An example parameters file is located [here](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/azuredeploy.parameters.example.json).

  - _`sshRSAPublicKey`_ - Your SSH public key - sample syntax: `ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...NDOCE7U3DLBISw==\n`.
  - _`spnClientId`_ - Your Azure service principal id.
  - _`spnClientSecret`_ - Your Azure service principal secret.
  - _`spnTenantId`_ - Your Azure tenant id.
  - _`windowsAdminUsername`_ - Client Windows VM Administrator name.
  - _`windowsAdminPassword`_ - Client Windows VM Password. Password must have 3 of the following: 1 lower case character, 1 upper case character, 1 number, and 1 special character. The value must be between 12 and 123 characters long.
  - _`logAnalyticsWorkspaceName`_ - Unique name for log analytics workspace deployment.
  - _`deploySQLMI`_ - Boolean that sets whether or not to deploy SQL Managed Instance, for this data controller only scenario we leave it set to _**false**_.
  - _`deployPostgreSQL`_ - Boolean that sets whether or not to deploy PostgreSQL, for this data controller only scenario we leave it set to _**false**_.
  - _`templateBaseUrl`_ - GitHub URL to the deployment template - filled in by default to point to [_microsoft/azure_arc_](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc) GitHub repository, but you can point this to your forked repo as well.
  - _`deployBastion`_ - Choice (true | false) to deploy Azure Bastion.

- You will also need to get the Azure Custom Location Resource Provider ([RP](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types)) Object ID (OID) and export it as an environment variable:

  > **NOTE: You need permissions to list all the service principals.**

  #### Option 1: Bash

  ```bash
  customLocationRPOID=$(az ad sp list --filter "displayname eq 'Custom Locations RP'" --query "[?appDisplayName=='Custom Locations RP'].id" -o tsv)
  ```

  #### Option 2: PowerShell

  ```powershell
  $customLocationRPOID=(az ad sp list --filter "displayname eq 'Custom Locations RP'" --query "[?appDisplayName=='Custom Locations RP'].id" -o tsv)
  ```

- To deploy the ARM template, navigate to the local cloned [deployment folder](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/tree/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template) and run the below command:

  ```shell
  az group create --name <Name of the Azure resource group> --location <Azure Region>
  az deployment group create \
  --resource-group <Name of the Azure resource group> \
  --name <The name of this deployment> \
  --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/azure_arc/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/azuredeploy.json \
  --parameters <The _azuredeploy.parameters.json_ parameters file location> \
  --parameters customLocationRPOID="$customLocationRPOID"
  ```

  > **NOTE: Make sure that you are using the same Azure resource group name as the one you've just used in the `azuredeploy.parameters.json` file**

  For example:

  ```shell
  az group create --name Arc-Data-Microk8s --location "East US"
  az deployment group create \
  --resource-group Arc-Data-Microk8s \
  --name arcdatademo \
  --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/azure_arc/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/azuredeploy.json \
  --parameters customLocationRPOID="$customLocationRPOID" \
  --parameters azuredeploy.parameters.json
  --parameters templateBaseUrl="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your--github--handle/azure_arc/microk8s-data/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/"
  ```

  > **NOTE: The deployment time for this scenario can take ~15-20min**

  > **NOTE: If you receive an error message stating that the requested VM size is not available in the desired location (as an example: 'Standard_D8s_v3'), it means that there is currently a capacity restriction for that specific VM size in that particular region. Capacity restrictions can occur due to various reasons, such as high demand or maintenance activities. Microsoft Azure periodically adjusts the available capacity in each region based on usage patterns and resource availability. To continue deploying this scenario, please try to re-run the deployment using another region.**

  ![Screenshot showing deployment time](./01.png)

- Once Azure resources have been provisioned, you will be able to see it in the Azure portal. At this point, the resource group should have **13 various Azure resources deployed**.

## Windows Login & Post Deployment

Various options are available to connect to _Arc-Data-Client_ VM, depending on the parameters you supplied during deployment.

- [RDP](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_data/microk8s/azure/arm_template/dc_vanilla/#connecting-directly-with-rdp) - available after configuring access to port 3389 on the _Arc-Data-Client-NSG_, or by enabling [Just-in-Time access (JIT)](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_data/microk8s/azure/arm_template/dc_vanilla/#connect-using-just-in-time-access-jit).
- [Azure Bastion](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_data/microk8s/azure/arm_template/dc_vanilla/#connect-using-azure-bastion) - available if ```true``` was the value of your _`deployBastion`_ parameter during deployment.

### Connecting directly with RDP

By design, port 3389 is not allowed on the network security group. Therefore, you must create an NSG rule to allow inbound 3389.

- Open the _Arc-Data-Client-NSG_ resource in Azure portal and click "Add" to add a new rule.

  ![Screenshot showing Arc-Data-Client NSG with blocked RDP](./05.png)

  ![Screenshot showing adding a new inbound security rule](./05.png)

- Specify the IP address that you will be connecting from and select RDP as the service with "Allow" set as the action. You can retrieve your public IP address by accessing [https://icanhazip.com](https://icanhazip.com) or [https://whatismyip.com](https://whatismyip.com).

  ![Screenshot showing all inbound security rule](./06.png)

  ![Screenshot showing all NSG rules after opening RDP](./07.png)

  ![Screenshot showing connecting to the VM using RDP](./08.png)

### Connect using Azure Bastion

- If you have chosen to deploy Azure Bastion in your deployment, use it to connect to the VM.

  ![Screenshot showing connecting to the VM using Bastion](./09.png)

  > **NOTE: When using Azure Bastion, the desktop background image is not visible. Therefore some screenshots in this guide may not exactly match your experience if you are connecting with Azure Bastion.**

### Connect using just-in-time access (JIT)

If you already have [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/just-in-time-access-usage?tabs=jit-config-asc%2Cjit-request-asc) enabled on your subscription and would like to use JIT to access the Client VM, use the following steps:

- In the Client VM configuration pane, enable just-in-time. This will enable the default settings.

  ![Screenshot showing the Microsoft Defender for cloud portal, allowing RDP on the client VM](./10.png)

  ![Screenshot showing connecting to the VM using JIT](./11.png)

### Post Deployment

- At first login, as mentioned in the "Automation Flow" section above, the [_DataServicesLogonScript_](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/microk8s/azure/arm_template/artifacts/DataServicesLogonScript.ps1) PowerShell logon script will start it's run.

- Let the script run it's course and **do not close** the PowerShell session, this will be done for you once completed.

  ![Screenshot showing PowerShell logon script run](./20.png)

  ![Screenshot showing PowerShell logon script run](./21.png)

  Once the script finishes it's run, the logon script PowerShell session will be closed, the Windows wallpaper will change, and the Azure Arc Data Controller will have been deployed on the cluster and be ready for use:

  ![Screenshot showing Wallpaper Change](./22.png)

- Since this scenario is deploying the Azure Arc Data Controller, you will also notice additional newly deployed Azure resources in the resources group (at this point you should have **16 various Azure resources deployed**. The important ones to notice are:

  - **Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster** - Azure Arc-enabled data services deployed in directly connected mode is using this resource to deploy the data services [cluster extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/conceptual-extensions), as well as using Azure Arc [Custom locations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/conceptual-custom-locations).

  - **Custom location** - Provides a way for tenant administrators to use their Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters as a target location for deploying Azure services.

  - **Azure Arc Data Controller** - The data controller that is now deployed on the Kubernetes cluster.

  ![Screenshot showing addtional Azure resources in the resource group](./23.png)

- Another tool automatically deployed is Azure Data Studio along with the _Azure Data CLI_, the _Azure Arc_ and the _PostgreSQL_ extensions. Using the Desktop shortcut created for you, open Azure Data Studio and click the Extensions settings to see both extensions.

  ![Screenshot showing Azure Data Studio shortcut](./24.png)

## Cluster extensions

In this scenario, **three** Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster extensions were deployed:

- `microsoft.azuredefender.kubernetes` - The Azure Defender cluster extension. To learn more about it, you can check our Jumpstart ["Integrate Azure Defender with Cluster API as an Azure Arc Connected Cluster using Kubernetes extensions"](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_k8s/day2/cluster_api/cluster_api_defender_extension/#create-azure-defender-extensions-instance) scenario.

- `azuremonitor-containers` - The Azure Monitor for containers cluster extension. To learn more about it, you can check our Jumpstart ["Integrate Azure Monitor for Containers with GKE as an Azure Arc Connected Cluster using Kubernetes extensions](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_k8s/day2/gke/gke_monitor_extension/) scenario.

- `arc-data-services` - The Azure Arc-enabled data services cluster extension that was used throughout this scenario in order to deploy the data services infrastructure.

  In order to view these cluster extensions, click on the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes resource Extensions settings.

  ![Screenshot showing Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes resource](./26.png)

  And we see the installed extensions:
