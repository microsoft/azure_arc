## Using Managed Identity on Azure Arc-enabled servers

The scenarios in this section will walk you through how to work with the Hybrid Instance Metadata Service on an Azure Arc-enabled server, and authenticate the system assigned Managed Identity against Azure APIs.

Using the managed identity opens up custom hybrid integration opportunities beyond the standard integrations such as monitoring, management, backup, and virtual machine extensions.

The workloads running on your on-premises, hosted, and multi-cloud compute can be onboarded to Azure using an Azure Arc-enabled server and you can then authenticate the managed identity to access Azure services.
