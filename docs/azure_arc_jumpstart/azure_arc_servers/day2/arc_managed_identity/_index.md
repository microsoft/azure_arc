  The scenarios in this section will walk you through how to work with the Hybrid Instance Metadata Service on an Azure Arc-enabled server, and authenticate the system assigned Managed Identity against Azure APIs.

  Using the managed identity opens up custom hybrid integration opportunities beyond the standard integrations such as monitoring, management, backup and virtual machine extensions.

  The workloads running on your on prem, hosted and multi-cloud compute can be onboarded to Azure using Azure Arc-enabled server and you can then authenticate the managed identity to access Azure services.
