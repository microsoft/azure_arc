  If you do not yet have a Kubernetes cluster, the scenarios in this section will guide on creating an AKS cluster with Azure Video Indexer enabled by Arc in an automated fashion using az commands. 
  
  The purpose of Azure Video Indexer enabled by Arc is to perform video and audio analysis on edge devices in a connected fashion, only control plane data is passed to the cloud, while data plane data is stored only on the edge device. 
  To achieve this goal, the video indexer extension that this guide explains how to create needs to be linked to an Azure Video Indexer cloud account. If you don't have such an account, this section will provide instructions on how to create one.
