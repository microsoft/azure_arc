# Azure Arc Jumpstart commitment to open-source software

The Azure Arc Jumpstart contains extensive automation and scripting for our scenarios and features, and for us, it is critical to maintain high code quality. To do that, it is important to not just go through extensive code reviews and testing, but also select and embed the right tools for the job.

It is our mission to support the open-source community whenever we can and build on the amazing work of others when presented with the opportunity to do so. With more than 30 open-source projects used in the Jumpstart, we are committed to continue to support, advocate and contribute to these projects, so you can expect an AWESOME open-source experience when using the Azure Arc Jumpstart!
