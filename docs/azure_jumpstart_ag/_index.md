## Jumpstart Agora - Overview

Jumpstart Agora is a marketplace of various “Cloud to Edge” industry scenarios, designed to provide an end-to-end user experience. The word "Agora" comes from the ancient Greek term for a public gathering place or assembly, and it has come to be used more broadly to refer to any place or forum where people come together for discussion or exchange.

Our mission is to create a rich marketplace of applications that can leverage Hybrid Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and make those accessible for enablement and educational purposes via the Jumpstart automation mechanisms.

### Use cases

- Sandbox environment for getting hands-on with “Cloud to Edge” industry scenarios.
- Accelerator for Proofs-of-concept or pilots.
- Training tool for various Microsoft Azure services and open-source projects skills development.
- Demo environment for customer presentations or events.
- Rapid integration testing platform.

### Agora scenarios

Each Agora scenario includes a comprehensive deployment stack, all the way from the foundation infrastructure to the line of business applications.

To achieve the goal of providing end-to-end “cloud to edge" hands-on experience, each Agora scenario incorporate application development concepts and delivery models, all as part of driving towards showing how developers can implement edge-based applications while increasing velocity. Our aspiration is for each scenario to have as many of the below concepts and design patterns.

- Distributed applications and cloud services integration
- Service discovery
- Performance
- Data plane design
- Scalability
- IoT integrations and various industry protocols
- Azure Arc integrations
- AI integrations
- Continues integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines
- Observability & Logging
- Security principals
- IDE experience
