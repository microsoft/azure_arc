# Enabling AI at the Edge & Software configurations rollout with basic GitOps flow

## Overview

Contoso prides itself on being technology innovators. In the current market, Contoso's leadership recognizes that maintaining their position as leaders in the retail space requires innovation in every aspect of their operations.

To this end, Contoso Supermarket has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) mechanism that empowers them to enhance the customer experience in their stores. By implementing such a mechanism, their objective is to accurately detect the number of people waiting at different checkout lanes and enable proactive actions based on this data.

Contoso has also adopted GitOps methodologies so they can enable their DevOps teams to centrally and gradually rollout new features developed by the development team to their stores in a controlled manner.

## Architecture

Contoso has four Kubernetes environments for their application rollout process (Dev, Staging, Canary, and Production), each environment is represented in their GitHub repository as a separate branch to allow developers to develop, test, and ship features and fixes in a controlled manner across each environment.

In each cluster, a queue monitoring frontend service is deployed to allow store managers to monitor the checkout queues and leverages the power of AI to detect the number of users in a certain queue so they can take immediate action to enhance the customers' checkout experience.

Contoso's DevOps team has adopted GitOps methodologies which allows them to use Git as the single source of truth for managing infrastructure and application deployments. It involves declarative definitions of infrastructure and application configurations, which are stored in Git repositories. The GitOps pipeline automatically detects any changes made to the repositories and triggers the necessary actions to deploy the changes to the target environments.

One of the main benefits of GitOps is its ability to provide a consistent and auditable deployment process. All changes to the infrastructure and application configurations are tracked and versioned in Git, making it easy to roll back to a previous state if necessary. The declarative nature of GitOps also enables the automation of the deployment process, which reduces the risk of human error and streamlines the entire process.

### AI at the Edge using Intel OpenVino

Contoso aims to maximize the usage of their existing Closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed across their stores. After careful evaluation, Contoso has opted to utilize Intel's OpenVino Technology for their solution. By leveraging OpenVino, Contoso can perform inference on the CPU of their edge devices, eliminating the need for expensive discrete GPUs. Intel also provides a set of pre-trained models that align with Contoso's requirements.

In this specific use case, Contoso has chosen the [_"person-detection-retail-0013 pre-trained model"_](https://docs.openvino.ai/2022.3/omz_models_model_person_detection_retail_0013.html). This model boasts an impressive Average Precision of 88.62% and accepts high-definition videos (1024x768) as input.

The developed application showcases the live video feed with bounding boxes encompassing identified individuals. Additionally, a heatmap is superimposed on the video to provide a visual representation of people density in different areas of the frame.

Furthermore, the application communicates the results via HTTP messages, enabling accessibility from other devices within the network. In the event of any errors or issues, they are promptly displayed in the console, aiding in the debugging process.

## Store Manager Experience

Contoso leverages their existing CCTV cameras by seamlessly integrating them into the store manager interface. This integration enables Store Managers to take immediate action, such as opening or closing lanes, based on the real-time data provided by the cameras. All data processing occurs locally using an edge device, ensuring compliance with corporate policies and safeguarding data privacy.

The "Managers Control Center" serves as the central hub of this experience. From this interface, store managers can easily monitor the number of people in each lane. The home page consists of two main areas.

To access the "Managers Control Center", select the POS [_env_] Manager option from the _POS_ Bookmarks folder. Each environment will have it's own "Managers Control Center" instance with a different IP.

- __Heatmap:__ Using the heatmap, the Store Manager can open or close checkout lanes to distribute the traffic of the store, using the Toggles above each lane.

    ![Screenshot showing the Store Manager Screenshot Heatmap focus](./img/checkout-heatmap.png)

- __Reporting:__ Contoso is interested in improving their store experience by measuring two key metrics: Total people in the store, and Shopper Wait Time. These metrics are shown in the Store Manager Control Center as shown below.

    ![Screenshot showing the Store Manager Reporting Pane](./img/reporting.png)

## Live View

These metrics are generated by combining an AI engine that captures inferences from the CCTV cameras with an application running the business logic. To provide visibility into the process of capturing these inferences, the Contoso Dev team has included an option to view the live video feed from one of their cameras.

Contoso has decided to have the "Live View" option enabled by default in the Dev and Staging environments.

Live View will be disabled by default in Seattle and Chicago environments as shown in the picture below:

### GitOps workflow

Contoso has deployed GitOps configurations for all of their services to make it easier for their developers to focus on code and streamline all the code build, test, and deployment activities. Flux v2 is the main driver for Contoso's GitOps workflow by monitoring the Git repository holding all the clusters' configurations and applications code for changes and automatically updating the deployed resources accordingly. This makes it easy for teams to manage their infrastructure as code, using Git as the single source of truth.

[GitOps on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/hybrid/arc-enabled-kubernetes/eslz-arc-kubernetes-cicd-gitops-disciplines) leverages Flux v2 to provide a unified experience for managing Kubernetes clusters across different environments. This integration allows users to deploy and manage applications in Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters, while also providing a centralized management plane through Azure Arc. This can simplify the process of managing Kubernetes clusters across different environments and provide greater visibility and control over the entire deployment process.

Before starting to code this new feature, it is useful to take a look at how Contoso's GitHub repository is structured.

- The GitHub repository for Contoso's applications has a branch per environment as follows:
  - _Main_ branch targets the local _Dev_ environment/cluster
  - _Staging_ branch targets the _Staging_ environment/cluster
  - _Canary_ branch targets the _Chicago_ environment/cluster
  - _Production_ branch targets the _Seattle_ environment/cluster

    ![Screenshot showing the GitHub repository branches](./img/repo_branches.png)

- The repository has two main folders to separate the development team applications' code (developer) and the DevOps team operations GitOps configurations (operations).

    ![Screenshot showing the GitHub repository main folder structure](./img/repo_folder_structure.png)

- Within the _developer_ folder there is a folder for each application's source code. This is where Contoso Supermarket's developers develop new features.

    ![Screenshot showing the developer folder structure](./img/repo_developer_structure.png)

- Within the _operations_ folder there is also a folder for each application's GitOps configuration. This is where Contoso Supermarket's DevOps team manages how the applications are deployed to the different environments.

    ![Screenshot showing the operations folder structure](./img/repo_operations_structure.png)

- Each application has a folder for [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/) _charts_ where the Kubernetes manifests for each application are located and a folder for _releases_ where the Helm Releases for each application and each environment is located. This way the DevOps team can control the promotion of each version of the applications across the GitOps workflow on different environments and also enable/disable features created by the developers as needed.
