## Azure Arc Jumpstart

The Azure Arc Jumpstart is designed to provide a "zero to hero" experience so you can start working with Azure Arc right away!

The Jumpstart provides step-by-step guides for independent Azure Arc scenarios that incorporate as much automation as possible, detailed screenshots and code samples, and a rich and comprehensive experience while getting started with the Azure Arc platform.

Our goal is for you to have a working Azure Arc environment spun-up in no time so you can focus on the core values of the platform, regardless of where your infrastructure may be, either on-premises or in the cloud.

## Jumpstart Scenarios

Ready to get going?! This website offers you detailed guides, automation, code samples, screenshots and everything you really need to get going with Azure Arc!

Hop over to the [Jumpstart Scenarios](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/) section and enjoy the ride.

> **Disclaimer: The intention for the Azure Arc Jumpstart project is to focus on the core Azure Arc capabilities, deployment scenarios, use-cases, and ease of use. It does not focus on Azure best-practices or the other tech and OSS projects being leveraged in the scenarios and code.**

## Jumpstart ArcBox

Have you ever wanted to have a complete Azure Arc environment with just one click? We've got you covered with ArcBox!

[ArcBox](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_jumpstart_arcbox/) is a dedicated sandbox environment for exploring all things Azure Arc, and the best part is that the only prerequisite is an Azure subscription.

## Community decks

Architecture diagrams and visualization are important so we wanted you to have our [official Azure Arc overview library, the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) hybrid deployment options library deck, and the Azure Arc Jumpstart overview PowerPoint decks](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/tree/main/docs/ppt) we use, just because you know, we care!

## Azure Arc Overview

For customers who want to simplify complex and distributed environments across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud, [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-arc/) enables deployment of Azure services anywhere and extends Azure management to any infrastructure.

* **Organize and govern across environments** - Get databases, Kubernetes clusters, and servers sprawling across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments under control by centrally organizing and governing from a single place.

* **Manage Kubernetes Apps at scale** - Deploy and manage Kubernetes applications across environments using DevOps techniques. Ensure that applications are deployed and configured from source control consistently.

* **Run Azure services anywhere** - Get automated patching, upgrades, security and scale on-demand across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments for your data estate.

## Azure Arc Story Time

Fabrikam Global Manufacturing runs workloads on different hardware, across on-premises datacenters, and multiple public clouds, with Microsoft Azure being the primary cloud. They also support IoT workloads deployed on the edge. Workloads include very diverse services and are based on either virtual machines, managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) services, and container-based applications.

As mentioned, Fabrikam’s R&D teams are well-invested in containerized workloads for their modernized applications. As a result, they are using Kubernetes as their container orchestration platform. Kubernetes is deployed both as self-managed Kubernetes clusters in their on-premises environments and managed Kubernetes deployments in the cloud.

As part of their cloud-native practices with Azure being the main hyper-scale cloud, Fabrikam’s operations teams are standardized and taking advantage of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) capabilities such as (but not limited to) tagging, Azure Monitoring for VMs and containers, logging and telemetry, policy and governance, Desired State Configuration (DSC), Update Management, Change Tracking, Inventory management, etc.

These practices and techniques are already well established for Azure-based workloads in use such as Azure VMs, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure SQL, and many more. In order to take advantage of these well-established practices, Fabrikam is using Azure Arc to extend the ARM APIs to project and manage their workloads deployed outside of Azure. Once onboarded, Azure Arc projects resources as first-class citizens in Azure which can then take advantage of the ARM capabilities mentioned above. In addition, they are able to guarantee Kubernetes deployments and app consistency through GitOps-based configuration for their Kubernetes clusters in Azure, other clouds and on-premises.

With Azure Arc, Fabrikam is able to project resources and register them into Azure Resource Manager independently of where they run, so they have a single control plane and can extend cloud-native operations and governance beyond Azure.
