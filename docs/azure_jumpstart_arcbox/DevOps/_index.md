## Jumpstart ArcBox for IT Pros

ArcBox for IT Pros is a special "flavor" of ArcBox that is intended for users who want to experience Azure Arc-enabled servers capabilities in a sandbox environment.

![ArcBox architecture diagram](./arch_devops.png)

### Use cases

- Sandbox environment for getting hands-on with Azure Arc technologies
- Accelerator for Proof-of-concepts or pilots
- Training tool for Azure Arc skills development
- Demo environment for customer presentations or events
- Rapid integration testing platform
- Infrastructure-as-code and automation template library for building hybrid cloud management solutions

## Azure Arc capabilities available in ArcBox for DevOps

### Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes

ArcBox deploys two Kubernetes clusters.

- One single-node Rancher K3s cluster running on an Azure virtual machine. This cluster is then connected to Azure as an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes resource (_ArcBox-K3s_).
- ArcBox deploys one single-node Rancher K3s cluster (_ArcBox-CAPI-MGMT_), which is then transformed to a [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/concepts.html) management cluster using the Cluster API Provider Azure(CAPZ), and a workload cluster is deployed onto the management cluster.

### App 

### GitOps

Lorem ipsum dolor whatever

### KeyVault integration

Lorem ipsum dolor whatever

### Microsoft Defender for Cloud / k8s integration

ArcBox deploys several management and operations services that work with ArcBox's Azure Arc resources, one of these services is Microsoft Defender for Cloud that is deployed by installing the [Defender extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-enable?tabs=aks-deploy-portal%2Ck8s-deploy-cli%2Ck8s-verify-cli%2Ck8s-remove-arc%2Caks-removeprofile-api#protect-arc-enabled-kubernetes-clusters) on your Kubernetes cluster in order to start collecting security related logs and telemetry.  

Kubernetes extensions are add-ons for Kubernetes clusters. The extensions feature on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters enables usage of Azure Resource Manager based APIs, CLI and portal UX for deployment of extension components (Helm charts in initial release) and will also provide lifecycle management capabilities such as auto/manual extension version upgrades for the extensions.

After you have finished the deployment of ArBox for DevOps, you can verify that Microsoft Defender for Cloud is working properly and alerting on security threats, by running the below command to simulate an alert:

```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace=asc-alerttest-662jfi039n --kubeconfig <cluster-name>.kubeconfig
```

Within 30 minutes Microsoft Defender for Cloud will detect this event and trigger a security alert that you wil see in the Azure Portal under Microsoft Defender for Cloud's security alerts and also on the security tab of your Azure Arc-enabled cluster.

### Hybrid Unified Operations

ArcBox deploys several management and operations services that work with ArcBox's Azure Arc resources. These resources include an an Azure Automation account, an Azure Log Analytics workspace with the Update Management solution, an Azure Monitor workbook, Azure Policy assignments for deploying Log Analytics agents on Windows and Linux Azure Arc-enabled servers, Azure Policy assignment for adding tags to resources, and a storage account used for staging resources needed for the deployment automation.

## ArcBox Azure Consumption Costs

ArcBox resources generate Azure Consumption charges from the underlying Azure resources including core compute, storage, networking and auxiliary services. Note that Azure consumption costs vary depending the region where ArcBox is deployed. Be mindful of your ArcBox deployments and ensure that you disable or delete ArcBox resources when not in use to avoid unwanted charges. Users may review cost analysis of ArcBox by using [Azure Cost Analysis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-acm-cost-analysis).

## Deployment Options and Automation Flow

ArcBox provides multiple paths for deploying and configuring ArcBox resources. Deployment options include:

- Azure portal
- ARM template via Azure CLI
- Bicep
- Terraform

![Deployment flow diagram for ARM-based deployments](./deploymentflow.png)

![Deployment flow diagram for Terraform-based deployments](./deploymentflow_tf.png)

ArcBox uses an advanced automation flow to deploy and configure all necessary resources with minimal user interaction. The previous diagrams provide an overview of the deployment flow. A high-level summary of the deployment is:

- User deploys the primary ARM template (_azuredeploy.json_), Bicep file (_main.bicep_), or Terraform plan (_main.tf_). These objects contain several nested objects that will run simultaneously.
  - ClientVM ARM template/plan - deploys the Client Windows VM. This is the Hyper-V host VM where all user interactions with the environment are made from.
  - Storage account template/plan - used for staging files in automation scripts
  - Management artifacts template/plan - deploys Azure Log Analytics workspace and solutions and Azure Policy artifacts
- User remotes into Client Windows VM, which automatically kicks off multiple scripts that:
  - step 1??? OSM bookstore app?
  - step 2??? gitops config?
  - step 3??? keyvault config?
  - Deploy an Azure Monitor workbook that provides example reports and metrics for monitoring ArcBox components

## Prerequisites

- [Install or update Azure CLI to version 2.15.0 and above](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). Use the below command to check your current installed version.

  ```shell
  az --version
  ```

- Login to AZ CLI using the ```az login``` command.

- Ensure that you have selected the correct subscription you want to deploy ArcBox to by using the ```az account list --query "[?isDefault]"``` command. If you need to adjust the active subscription used by Az CLI, follow [this guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli#change-the-active-subscription).

- ArcBox must be deployed to one of the following regions. **Deploying ArcBox outside of these regions may result in unexpected results or deployment errors.**

  - East US
  - East US 2
  - West US 2
  - North Europe
  - France Central
  - UK South
  - Southeast Asia

- **ArcBox DevOps requires XXXX DSv4-series vCPUs** when deploying with default parameters such as VM series/size. Ensure you have sufficient vCPU quota available in your Azure subscription and the region where you plan to deploy ArcBox. You can use the below Az CLI command to check your vCPU utilization.

  ```shell
  az vm list-usage --location <your location> --output table
  ```

  ![Screenshot showing az vm list-usage](./azvmlistusage.png)

- Register necessary Azure resource providers by running the following commands.

  ```shell
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.GuestConfiguration --wait
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Kubernetes --wait
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration --wait
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ExtendedLocation --wait
  ```

- Create Azure service principal (SP). To deploy ArcBox, an Azure service principal assigned with multiple role-based access control (RBAC) roles is required:

  - "Contributor" - Required for provisioning Azure resources
  - "Security admin" - Required for installing Microsoft Defender for Cloud Azure-Arc enabled Kubernetes extension and dismiss alerts
  - "Security reader" - Required for being able to view Azure-Arc enabled Kubernetes Cloud Defender extension findings
  - "Monitoring Metrics Publisher" - Required for being Azure Arc-enabled data services billing, monitoring metrics, and logs management
  - **(optional)** "User Access Administrator" - Required for automatically onboarding the Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server resource

    To create it login to your Azure account run the below command (this can also be done in [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/).

    ```shell
    az login
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "<Unique SP Name>" --role "Contributor"
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "<Unique SP Name>" --role "Security admin"
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "<Unique SP Name>" --role "Security reader"
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "<Unique SP Name>" --role "Monitoring Metrics Publisher"
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "<Unique SP Name>" --role "User Access Administrator"
    ```

    For example:

    ```shell
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "JumpstartArcBox" --role "Contributor"
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "JumpstartArcBox" --role "Security admin"
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "JumpstartArcBox" --role "Security reader"
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "JumpstartArcBox" --role "Monitoring Metrics Publisher"
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "JumpstartArcBox" --role "User Access Administrator"
    ```

    Output should look similar to this:

    ```json
    {
    "appId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "displayName": "AzureArcBox",
    "name": "http://AzureArcBox",
    "password": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "tenant": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
    ```

    > **NOTE: The Jumpstart scenarios are designed with as much ease of use in-mind and adhering to security-related best practices whenever possible. It is optional but highly recommended to scope the service principal to a specific [Azure subscription and resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest) as well considering using a [less privileged service principal account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/best-practices)**

- [Generate SSH Key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) (or use existing ssh key)

  ```shell
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```

## Deployment Option 1: Azure portal

  - **_`workspace_name`_** - Unique name for the ArcBox Log Analytics workspace

  > **NOTE: Any variables in bold are required. If any optional parameters are not provided, defaults will be used.**

- Now you will deploy the Terraform file. Navigate to the local cloned [deployment folder](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/tree/main/azure_jumpstart_arcbox/bicep) and run the commands below:

  ```shell
  terraform init
  terraform plan -out=infra.out
  terraform apply "infra.out"
  ```
  
- Example output from `terraform init`:

  ![terraform init](./terraform_init.png)

- Example output from `terraform plan -out=infra.out`:

  ![terraform plan](./terraform_plan.png)

- Example output from `terraform apply "infra.out"`:

  ![terraform plan](./terraform_apply.png)

## Start post-deployment automation

- After deployment, you should see the ArcBox resources inside your resource group.

  ![Screenshot showing az deployment group create](./deployedresources.png)

  > **NOTE: If you followed the steps in [prerequisites](#prerequisites) to allow the SQL Server to be automatically onboarded, there will be one additional resource in your ArcBox resource group (48 total)**

- Open a remote desktop connection into _ArcBox-Client_. Upon logging in, multiple automated scripts will open and start running. These scripts usually take 10-20 minutes to finish and once completed the script windows will close. At this point, the deployment is complete.

  ![Screenshot showing ArcBox-Client](./automation5.png)

  ![Screenshot showing ArcBox resources in Azure portal](./rgarc.png)

## Using ArcBox

After deployment is complete, its time to start exploring ArcBox. Most interactions with ArcBox will take place either from Azure itself (Azure portal, CLI or similar) or from inside the _ArcBox-Client_ virtual machine. When remoted into the client VM, here are some things to try:

- thing 1
- thing 2

### App

### GitOps configurations

### KeyVault integration

### ArcBox Azure Monitor workbook

Open the [ArcBox Azure Monitor workbook](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_jumpstart_arcbox/workbook/flavors/DevOps) and explore the visualizations and reports of hybrid cloud resources. A [dedicated README](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_jumpstart_arcbox/workbook/flavors/DevOps) is available with more detail on usage of the workbook.

  ![Screenshot showing Azure Monitor workbook usage](./workbook.png)

### Included tools

The following tools are including on the _ArcBox-Client_ VM.

- kubectl, kubectx, helm
- Chocolatey
- Visual Studio Code
- Putty
- 7zip
- Terraform
- Git
- SqlQueryStress

### Next steps
  
ArcBox is a sandbox that can be used for a large variety of use cases, such as an environment for testing and training or a kickstarter for proof of concept projects. Ultimately, you are free to do whatever you wish with ArcBox. Some suggested next steps for you to try in your ArcBox are:

- Deploy sample databases to the PostgreSQL Hyperscale instance or to the SQL Managed Instance
- Use the included kubectx to switch contexts between the two Kubernetes clusters
- Deploy GitOps configurations with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes
- Build policy initiatives that apply to your Azure Arc-enabled resources
- Write and test custom policies that apply to your Azure Arc-enabled resources
- Incorporate your own tooling and automation into the existing automation framework
- Build a certificate/secret/key management strategy with your Azure Arc resources

Do you have an interesting use case to share? [Submit an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/issues/new/choose) on GitHub with your idea and we will consider it for future releases!

## Clean up the deployment

To clean up your deployment, simply delete the resource group using Azure CLI or Azure portal.

```shell
az group delete -n <name of your resource group>
```

![Screenshot showing az group delete](./azdelete.png)

![Screenshot showing group delete from Azure portal](./portaldelete.png)

## Basic Troubleshooting

Occasionally deployments of ArcBox may fail at various stages. Common reasons for failed deployments include:

- Invalid service principal id, service principal secret or service principal Azure tenant ID provided in _azuredeploy.parameters.json_ file.
- Invalid SSH public key provided in _azuredeploy.parameters.json_ file.
  - An example SSH public key is shown here. Note that the public key includes "ssh-rsa" at the beginning. The entire value should be included in your _azuredeploy.parameters.json_ file.

      ![Screenshot showing SSH public key example](./ssh_example.png)

- Not enough vCPU quota available in your target Azure region - check vCPU quota and ensure you have at least XXXX available. See the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section for more details.
- Target Azure region does not support all required Azure services - ensure you are running ArcBox in one of the supported regions listed in the above section "ArcBox Azure Region Compatibility".
- "BadRequest" error message when deploying - this error returns occasionally when the Log Analytics solutions in the ARM templates are deployed. Typically, waiting a few minutes and re-running the same deployment resolves the issue. Alternatively, you can try deploying to a different Azure region.

  ![Screenshot showing BadRequest errors in Az CLI](./error_badrequest.png)

  ![Screenshot showing BadRequest errors in Azure portal](./error_badrequest2.png)

### Exploring logs from the _ArcBox-Client_ virtual machine

Occasionally, you may need to review log output from scripts that run on the _ArcBox-Client_, _ArcBox-CAPI-MGMT_ or _ArcBox-K3s_ virtual machines in case of deployment failures. To make troubleshooting easier, the ArcBox deployment scripts collect all relevant logs in the _C:\ArcBox\Logs_ folder on _ArcBox-Client_. A short description of the logs and their purpose can be seen in the list below:

| Logfile | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| _C:\ArcBox\Logs\Bootstrap.log_ | Output from the initial bootstrapping script that runs on _ArcBox-Client_. |
| _C:\ArcBox\Logs\DevOpsLogonScript.log_ | Output of _DevOpsLogonScript.ps1_ which configures the Hyper-V host and guests and onboards the guests as Azure Arc-enabled servers. |
| _C:\ArcBox\Logs\installCAPI.log_ | Output from the custom script extension which runs on _ArcBox-CAPI-MGMT_ and configures the Cluster API for Azure cluster and onboards it as an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. If you encounter ARM deployment issues with _ubuntuCapi.json_ then review this log. |
| _C:\ArcBox\Logs\installK3s.log_ | Output from the custom script extension which runs on _ArcBox-K3s_ and configures the Rancher cluster and onboards it as an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. If you encounter ARM deployment issues with _ubuntuRancher.json_ then review this log. |
| _C:\ArcBox\Logs\MonitorWorkbookLogonScript.log_ | Output from _MonitorWorkbookLogonScript.ps1_ which deploys the Azure Monitor workbook. |

  ![Screenshot showing ArcBox logs folder on ArcBox-Client](./troubleshoot_logs.png)

### Exploring installation logs from the Linux virtual machines

In the case of a failed deployment, pointing to a failure in either the _ubuntuRancherDeployment_ or the _ubuntuCAPIDeployment_ Azure deployments, an easy way to explore the deployment logs is available directly from the associated virtual machines.

  ![Screenshot showing failed deployments](./failed_deployments.png)

- Depends on which deployment failed, connect using SSH to the associated virtual machine public IP:
  - _ubuntuCAPIDeployment_ - _ArcBox-CAPI-MGMT_ virtual machine.
  - _ubuntuRancherDeployment_ - _ArcBox-K3s_ virtual machine.

    Since you are logging in using the provided SSH public key, all you need is the _arcdemo_ username.

      ![Screenshot showing ArcBox-CAPI-MGMT virtual machine public IP](./arcbox_capi_mgmt_vm_ip.png)

      ![Screenshot showing ArcBox-K3s virtual machine public IP](./arcbox_k3s_vm_ip.png)

- As described in the message of the day (motd), depends on which virtual machine you logged into, the installation log can be found in the *jumpstart_logs* folder. This installation logs can help determine the root cause for the failed deployment.
  - _ArcBox-CAPI-MGMT_ log path: *jumpstart_logs/installCAPI.log*
  - _ArcBox-K3s_ log path: *jumpstart_logs/installK3s.log*

      ![Screenshot showing login and the message of the day](./login_motd.png)

- From the screenshot below, looking at _ArcBox-CAPI-MGMT_ virtual machine CAPI installation log using the `cat jumpstart_logs/installCAPI.log` command, we can see the _az login_ command failed due to bad service principal credentials.

  ![Screenshot showing cat command for showing installation log](./cat_command.png)

  ![Screenshot showing az login error](./az_login_error.png)

If you are still having issues deploying ArcBox, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/issues/new/choose) on GitHub and include a detailed description of your issue, the Azure region you are deploying to, the flavor of ArcBox you are trying to deploy. Inside the _C:\ArcBox\Logs_ folder you can also find instructions for uploading your logs to an Azure storage account for review by the Jumpstart team.
