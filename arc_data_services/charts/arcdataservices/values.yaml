# ---------------------------- Direct <> Indirect ----------------------------
#'connectionMode' is used to figure out when to apply 'direct' mode specific
# resources by the entity applying the helm chart.
# 
# The 2 entities that will apply this helm chart are:
#
# 1. `arc-bootstrapper-job` - indirect -> projects/azure-cli-extension/.../dc/client.py -> bootstrap_create()
# 2.   `extension-manager`  -  direct  ->    https://bit.ly/ArcExtensionOperator_helm   -> reconcileHelmRelease()
#
# By default, this starts with indirect, and at helm publish time for Connected
# K8s in the build pipeline, this is changed to 'direct' inline.
connectionMode: indirect
